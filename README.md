# Bias-Variance-Trade-Off
This repository provides code, data, and scripts for the study on "k-fold cross-validation and the bias–variance trade-off". It includes preprocessing, experiments, and visualisations for analysing how varying k affects bias and variance across SVM, DT, LR, and KNN models on multiple datasets.
